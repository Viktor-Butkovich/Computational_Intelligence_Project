# Computational_Intelligence_Project
 
Brainstorming:
Genetic programming code synthesis
Genetic programming parameter optimization for another AI method
Application to Second Earth
    Design EC parameter optimizer to create an accurate temperature function based on Earth, Mars, etc. data
Application to databases/data warehouses/analytics
Time series analysis
Involve data collection from a web API - space or job data?
    Perhaps some analysis of Mars rover data, exoplanet catalog, comparison of solar system training data with other systems
    Data from ancient Earth over time, climate projections?
        Would be really cool to collect lots of Earth data over time to try to create an average temperature prediction
        May be a good situation for lexicase selection for Earth-like, Venus-like, Mars-like planets
            Can cite various planetary science, climate science papers, especially for climate datasets
Involve AWS - Bedrock, free student account, etc.
Can always look at UC Irvine, Kaggle, etc. datasets

Make sure to cite paleoclimate database and Holocene_temperature.pdf paper
